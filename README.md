## Feed Reader Testing

### About
This project is an web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 
I have done a couple of tests using Jasmine, to make sure it runs error free!


### Tests

#### RSS Feeds:
- All feeds are defined and tested
- Tested URL'S feeds to be defined and with content
- Tested name feeds to be defined and with content


#### Menu:

- Tested if menu element is hidden by default
- Tested if menu shows up on click over "menu Icon"
- The map view can be reseted either by clicking on the Reset MAp button, or just by resizing the window

#### First RSS Entry:

- Tested if at least one of the feed entry loads

#### RSS Entry Change:

- Tested if the RSS feed entry changes on different menu select
